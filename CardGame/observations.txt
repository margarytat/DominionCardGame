When debugging: in CardTable, GetCopyOfChosenCards has 11 elements: [Village, Woodcutter, Smithy, Laboratory, Market, Festival, Cellar, Chapel, Moat, Moneylender, Witch, null, null, null, null].

Just played two markets in a row in a hand where I started with 3 coppers, and was told in the buy phase that I have 3 buys and 4 money

Observation 2: 

Open Declarationjavax.swing.table.TableColumn

A TableColumn represents all the attributes of a column in a JTable, such as width, resizability, minimum and maximum width. In addition, the TableColumn provides slots for a renderer and an editor that can be used to display and edit the values in this column.

It is also possible to specify renderers and editors on a per type basis rather than a per column basis - see the setDefaultRenderer method in the JTable class. This default mechanism is only used when the renderer (or editor) in the TableColumn is null.

The TableColumn stores the link between the columns in the JTable and the columns in the TableModel. The modelIndex is the column in the TableModel, which will be queried for the data values for the cells in this column. As the column moves around in the view this modelIndex does not change.

Note: Some implementations may assume that all TableColumnModels are unique, therefore we would recommend that the same TableColumn instance not be added more than once to a TableColumnModel. To show TableColumns with the same column of data from the model, create a new instance with the same modelIndex.

- extra line after playing card
- sort how the hand is printed

Bot 2 bought a Chapel

Chapel is a great thing to buy for the bot given its deck now, but how does it result in a higher hand money value? what is the bot’s deck? Need to add deck printout method for the human to be able to invoke during her turns

Same game, turn 10.
It’s interesting to observe the bot. Choosing a card that results in the highest hand value ends up being a bit more reactive than proactive, but quite reasonable. It does result in cards that work well with the existing deck. In turn 9 below, the bot finally gets an action card with extra actions.

usability: when playing chapel, the player’s hand should be printed out before asking her for number of cards to trash

Bot’s turn 17 below. It should have bought a duchy. Current code only considers own and others’ victory points when it’s possible to buy a province with the current hand.
