# CardGame
This is a console version of Dominion with some of the base deck implemented. Dominion is a fun OOP project as one designs knowing what's coming in the expansions. I'm mostly interested in writing a bot; mine currently uses a combination of simulation and heuristics.

My MVP was a game with only treasures and victory cards.
